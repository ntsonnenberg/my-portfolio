# My Personal Portfolio Site

## This is my personal porfolio website to explain who I am and what I'm doing in my life. This website has 4 main sections to it. It has an About Me page that gives a little background of who I am. It has a Business Experience page that has insights into my professional experience. It has a Sonnenberg Group page that has insights into my business and what we do. And it has a Mission page that explains my LDS mission and what I did there.
